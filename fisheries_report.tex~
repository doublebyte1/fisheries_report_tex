\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}
The project’s longer-term development objective is to contribute to the sustainable management of the fisheries exploiting the living resources of the Ocean in general, in accordance with the Code of Conduct for Sustainable Fisheries and the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries.
The immediate objective is to improve the technological (software/hardware) component of the small-scale fisheries monitoring system. For that purpose, we are going to review the existent fisheries management systems, analysing their strengths and their limitations, and propose a set of solutions, based on the latest technologies on databases and Geographical Information Systems.

%\section{Background and Justification}\label{background}
\section{Background}\label{background}
According to~\cite{fao1}, "decision making for fisheries policy-making, planning and management relies largely on processed information, not raw data". Often the datasets are so large, that the only way to deal with them is through a Database Management System (DBMS). The DBMS in this context may have many functions, but the most relevant ones are: to store the data and ensure its validity and compatibility; it should also be capable of processing it and outputting it, in different ways.

When designing a complete system, many components should be take into account; namely, the User Interface (UI), the data entry, the data processing, the reporting and the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) functionalities (that can be involved in many of the previous steps); the documentation is also something to consider, as it ensures the usability of the system, and some of the reviewed systems also tackle the component of knowledge transfer, through tutorials and workshops. It was not found any system that implemented all of these components, but they seem to focus on some of them instead (for instance,  data processing). As long as the system focus on interoperability, by using open standards and free and open source software (FOSS), this is not a problem since we can combine different systems for our purposes, and avoid in this way, the redundancy on development.

In terms of architecture, there are many options available for building such system; ranging from using complete commercial solutions, by tying together different components, to creating a tailor-made application; all of them have different advantages and inconvenients. In this review, we tried to focus mostly on systems that are already in use, rather than in proposals or assessments of "how" systems should be. This is because to be put in place, fisheries management systems may face many obstacles, such as: burocracy, costs, etc; their ability to cope with them is also part of their success. 

\subsection{General Context}\label{context}
In this section we describe the results of reviewing 25 fisheries management systems. The criteria for selecting the systems that integrate this review, was their visibility; either because they were referred by some colleague, or because they appeared in the internet - as a result of search queries, or within the site of some well-known institution/organisation.

These were some key aspects that were taken into account, when reviewing the systems:
\begin{itemize}
\item security
\item engaging and involvement of stakeholders
\item validation    
\item ability to export information  
\item modular architecture and scalability   
\item licensing     
\item ability to work with incomplete data     
\item status (completed, draft, etc)     
\end{itemize}    
    
Whenever possible the software was tested, but in some cases, where this option was not available, the review is based on user manuals/articles or webpages. Finally it is important to note that often, the systems do not present any information about the type of license, even if sometimes they are distributed at no charge. 

The results of this review, are summarized in a table, on a SQLite database~\cite{bd}. In the next few paragraphs, we are going to analyse the content of this table, reviewing specific characteristics of these systems.

Most of the systems analysed include some sort of database system, to store and manage information (see Figure~\ref{analysis1}a). The DBMS found are very diverse, ranging from free systems such as MYSQL, to expensive proprietary solutions such as Oracle or MS SQL Server. Nevertheless, the majority of the systems use MS Access DB, which although commercial, is low-cost solution (and there are even some free versions). 

\begin{figure}[ht]

 }
\caption[Aggregated analysis of the use of specific software components in the reviewed fisheries management systems;]
{Aggregated analysis of the use of specific software components in the reviewed fisheries management systems;}
\label{analysis1}
\end{figure}

The same conclusion can be drawn about GIS (see Figure~\ref{analysis1}b). The majority of systems uses a GIS component, or has a direct connection with GIS. However, the number of systems without GIS is close to the number of systems with GIS. 

\begin{figure}[ht]

\subfigure[Need of internet connection, in order to run the software;]{

 }
\caption[Aggregated analysis of specific characteristics the reviewed fisheries management systems;]
{Aggregated analysis of specific characteristics the reviewed fisheries management systems;}
\label{analysis2}
\end{figure}

As we can see in see figure~\ref{analysis2}a, the vast majority of the reviewed systems does not require an internet connection, in order to work. Also because some of the systems, are low in technology and make little (or no) use of the computer. However, it has to be said, that in modern systems there is an increase use of the server-client architecture, where they centralize the information (database, maps), and serve it through "thin" clients (normally web browsers). The use of web-mapping services such as WMS, triggered a "boom" in the adoption of this kind of model. It is important to note, that although the big advantage of this model is its distributed use, it may also possible to setup it locally on a LAN, or even in a single computer,

Most of the reviewed systems, whether they use software or not, do not present any information about the type of license in place (if any). This can be a consequence of the fact that most of the systems are not distributed, since they are nowhere available for download.

Moreover, most systems do not require a high knoweledge of GIS, databases, statistics, etc, in order to be used (see figure~\ref{analysis2}b). This is either because: costum made solutions were implemented ("tailor-made" software), or widely-known software is used (like for instance MS Access). However, in some cases, specific tools are used that require a bit more literacy (for instance R); in this cases, there is a trade-off since there is something to gain in terms of potentialities of the software allowing to perform more complex tasks, but it is also narrowed the number of possible adopters.

      \caption[Software licenses;] {Software licenses;}
      \label{licensing} % so that one can \ref it elsewhere	
    \end{center} 
  \end{figure}

As we can see in figure~\ref{licensing}, most of the reviewed systems, whether they use software or not, do not present any information about the type of license in place (if any). This may be a consequence of the fact that they are not widely distributed (?).

From the systems that especify licenses, there is the same amount of proprietary and open-source type licenses, which clearly indicates the existence of the two segments. Looking at the timeline, there has been an increased adoption of "free and open-source-type" licences, and the expression of interest in adopting these licenses in systems that still rely on proprietary components. This is a very positive trend with great social impacts, specially regarding the adoption of these systems in developing countries.

%Many systems have been developed on the past few years, in order to address the modern challenges of fisheries data management. Some of these systems (like for instance Fishframe~\cite{fishframe}) developed quite a lot some components of the system such as data importing or validation but did not cover other components, such as raw data acquiring which being the first step, is in many cases essential for the overall functioning of the system. There are also many examples of systems (\cite{fishframe},~\cite{intercatch}) which use the web has a primary interface and therefore require a stable Internet connection, with a significant bandwidth; although this is desirable, and progressively more common, it is not always the scenario we encounter in developing countries, and therefore this fact should be taken in account when planning and designing a system that should reach the maximum number of adopters.\\
%Although free and/or open source is increasingly recognized as a valuable development and licensing model and some fisheries management systems had already adopt it (see~\cite{fishframe}), the  fact that they still rely partially or fully in proprietary software, like for instance MS Access (see \cite{intercatch},~\cite{tuna}), prevents them from fully enjoying the advantages of such a model; these advantages include, amongst many other things, the zero development cost that can increase the software ownership by countries with limited budgets (see section~\ref{objectives}).\\
%Unfortunately, FishFrame, Intercatch and the Canadian Albacore Tuna Catch and Effort Relational Database System are still not the rule, and in many places such as Dominican Republic, Western Samoa or Uganda, the technological component and automation of tasks are still in their early stages (see~\cite{victoria},~\cite{dominican},~\cite{samoa}); data collection methods are still limited to sheets of paper and databases are still not implemented to store and manage this data; needless to say GIS as modelling/visualization tools are nearly inexistent, although the "need" of a spatial support for information is clearly shown by hand-drawn maps.\\
In the next section (see~\ref{objectives}) we present a set of fisheries management tools that pretend to fill some of these "gaps" on existent systems, reusing some of its (good) ideas and adding new technologies that are "giving cards" on other fields (like fuzzy mapping, on section~\ref{output}, or artificial intelligence), having in mind the limitations and potentialities of the recipients (developing countries). Some of these ideas also arise during the development of Medfisis-CAS~\cite{medfisis}, an (almost) full and open-source system that reunites data from Logbook and Artisanal Fisheries in the same application/database; some of the concepts developed during this project such as abstractability of entities and configurability of components can be very useful in all stages of Fisheries Management Systems.\\
Figure~\ref{challenges} shows some of the challenges that can be addressed by a set of fisheries management tools. We propose a loose couple architecture, where we maximize the use of existing tools: to cut development time, to benefit from their value and also to involve a community of users that can take advantage of their expertise in specialized tools (like for instance R, or QGIS) to push the system further. The modularization of the system also means that we can distribute tasks, and till a certain extent develop them independently without compromising the rest of the system.\\

\section{Project Objectives}\label{objectives}
The design of a software system for fisheries management, as described in section~\ref{background} (figure~\ref{challenges}), should contemplate four stages:
\textbf{input, validation, transformation and output}. The main target for each of this stages is the data about fisheries, in its raw or transformed state (catch, efforts), but it can also be other (complementary) types of data (meteorological, oceanographical, socio-economic, etc). In the following subsections we identify a serious of tasks that are \textit{on-demand}, and could result in very useful tools for fisheries scientists and managers. They are not limitative, and in our modular design they can be seen as a first approach rather than a complete description of the system.\\

\subsection{Data Input}\label{input}
The data input component contemplates the collection of information for the system, either by creating this information "from scratch" or by importing it from different supports/formats.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Tools for Sampling Design}: Before even introducing information in the system, it is often necessary to collect this information; the design of a an unbiased sampling scheme, that minimizes the costs and maximizes the quality of the results it is an important and often overlooked task; overlooked, because many times the designer is not provided with the necessary tools to make it an easy and efficient process. There are many advantages of using a spatial framework (GIS) on this particular problem, and suggestions can guide the sampler to informed and wise decisions.
  \item \textbf{Research on Open Standards and Distributed Models for Data Exchange:} The problem of exchanging data between different instances of the system is a pertinent and frequent one. JSON~\cite{json} and SQLite~\cite{sqlite} are open and well-known standards that are "light" alternatives to XML. Also, the design and implementation of a server-client model, where we leave the "heavy processing load" to the server and create "light" data acquiring clients (for instance running on mobile phones and Ipads) can simplify the task of data integration, as we only update restricted parts of the system.
  \item \textbf{Data Recovering Tools:} There is a large quantity of historical data that is lost in terms of its value, just because it is not in an usable format. Data series take many years to assemble, and not only it costs a lot of money to generate new data, but it is not actually possible to recreate past information, so when this information is lost it is lost forever. It could be a very rewarding task to at least try to compile this information, that may not be usable for different reasons; hard disks that have bad sectors, obscure data formats whose specification was lost, data in non digital support and nearly illegible: these are all problems eligible for "data archaeology", that can make use of advanced software techniques such as: writing recognition, deyncription algorithms and hard-disk recover tools.
  \item \textbf{Integrate data from different systems/sources:} The integration of different types of information provides a rich basis for the analysis and transformation of information; this includes having data from different sources such as oceanographical, meteorological, sociological, etc; apart from implementing a system that is able to import different formats (satellite images, excel spreadsheets, vector maps, etc) it is also relevant to design a system that can deal with the nature of this variability - for instance recreational fisheries data, logbooks and sales slips can be integrated with a unified and generic design and provide a richer basis for fisheries statistical analysis (see~\cite{medfisis}).
  \item \textbf{Data Entry User Interfaces:} Database clients are a \textit{milestone} in fisheries applications and common examples of this are digital logbooks and fleet register software's (see~\cite{medfisis}). They reproduce the behavior of paper sheets for data collection, with all the advantages of data checking, and "feed" directly the database; if they are well designed and the data operators are trained, are also quicker and more friendly to use than the replaced papper sheets. There is still a room for improvement on this UIs, for instance enabling multiple choices or configurable validation rules~\footnote{As an example, some of this features were already implemented in CAS Medfisis~\cite{medfisis}}.

    \end{center} 
  \end{figure}

\subsection{Data Validation}\label{validation}
Since the data entering the system may arrive from sources other than its data generator interfaces\footnote{The data entry interfaces should have already their own validation routines removing, at least partially, the need for this step.}, it is important to control the quality and validity of information we are inputing; this step is fundamental for all the following ones, since "bad quality" data will compromise the entire system ("garbage in, garbage out").\\
The Fishframe application~\cite{fishframe}, developed by the Danish Institute for Fisheries Research, presents an interesting and complete multi-step validation layer; on a first stage it is performed a basic check, looking at the structure of the data, ranges of values and duplicate values; on a second stage, a more complex check searches for the correctness of the dependency between fields; finally, the last check (which is not compulsory) performs a global analysis, looking at the general patterns in order to identify outliers. Apart from this, it also allows some customizable checks to be introduced by the user, that can be performed automatically. This flexibility and completeness of the validity step, inspired us to identify the following tasks in the data validation component of this system:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Detection of redundant data}: The detection (and consequent removal) of duplicate records is an important task, in order to have a "clean" database. It is not complicate to identify automatically records that are \textbf{exactly} identical, but the problems arise when we have for instance spelling mistakes, and records that are \textit{almost} the same, but not exactly the same. As this situations are dubious, and may correspond or not to duplicate data, they require user supervision to confirm it; however, there is no reason why they can not be identified and presented to the operator has "possible duplicates"; for this task, it is very useful to use data mining techniques such as a fuzzy approach to language~\cite{fuzzy}.

  \item \textbf{Detection of invalid data based on configurable rules}: Generic rules can be applied to check for the correctness of the data types, correctness of keys, etc, directly based on the database schema. However, some rules such as the format of strings, ranges of values, may change from system to system  (for instance according to the geographic location) and the option to create them should be left to the user. To avoid "hard-coding" of rules, which would require a programmer's intervention and consequently difficult the process of exploratory analysis, we propose an interface for user configurable rules. This interface can be similar to a query builder such as the one represented in~\ref{builder}, which may be familiar to some users.

  \item \textbf{Detection of Outliers}: Outliers might arise due to careless data acquiring, instrument malfunction, wrong data processing routines, or any other reasons~\cite{outliers}; generic methods based on tabular data (for instance using a principal component analysis) can be used to perform this task, but there is also room for other techniques such as data mining, or GIS; for data with a spatial distribution (which is often the case in fisheries) GIS can provide a very valuable tool for capturing the general spatial pattern and consequently the values that fall outside this pattern (outliers)(see figure~\ref{dem}).
  After detecting and removing outliers values, we are left with the problem of imputation of "missing values" to replace the removed information (see section~\ref{transformation})

\end{itemize}

    \end{center} 
  \end{figure}


\subsection{Data Transformation}\label{transformation}
Data transformation consists in using the information in the system and apply transformations to it, in order to generate new information. These transformations may be used to estimate values extending the scope of the dataset, or to generate indicators that characterize the dataset, like for instance the CPUE, or both. In this system we suggest facilitating the export of data and leave (some) more complex data analysis to specialized software such as R (figure~\ref{lengths}) or QGis(figure~\ref{layers}).

    \end{center} 
  \end{figure}

Bellow are examples of some specific (and common) problems with catch data, for which we propose to develop some solutions in the system.% One is that we are missing data from our sampling universe (for instance it is an outlier or simply it was not sampled); the other is the data exists, but it is incomplete since the 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Imputation of missing data}: Under-sampled or non sampled strata lead to an unknown bias, a problem that should be reduced with a good sampling design~\cite{ices}. For the situations where we have to deal with missing values, it is possible to inmputate them, having in mind that also the method used for this operation can introduce some bias in the system. According to ICES~\cite{ices} automatic methods should be avoid, in favor of expert knowledge, but they can be aided by spatial modelling techniques having in mind that to be use with success the spatial distribution should remain stable over time; this is a cue for developing GIS based models, that can provide the expert with a good basis for informed choices.

  \item \textbf{Allocate Catch in undefined areas}: On the Canadian Albacore Tuna Catch and Effort Relational Database~\cite{tuna} it is presented the problem of having sales or logbook catch data, whose geographic area is undefined. Instead of discarding these values from the calculations of catch by area, the authors found ways to distribute the catch and effort, following the overall geographic pattern of fleet; they allocate these values in proportion with the total catch and vessel distribution and for this purpose GIS can be very useful, for instance to produce a grid, or a contour map (see figure~\ref{kernel}) with frequencies.

  \item \textbf{Estimate known unreported catch}: Another delicate problem arises from the incomplete vessel count. If there is an unreported effort than it will probably be reflected in an unreported catch. For the cases where it is known that an unreported effort exists, the authors of the the Canadian Albacore Tuna Catch and Effort Relational Database~\cite{tuna} suggest to extrapolate the total catch estimates based, on estimated number of unreported vessels. According to~\cite{morocco}, unreported catch can be as significant as 50\% of the total catch and therefore it is important to find suitable methods to approach this problem, like for instance the Monte Carlo Simulation (see figure~\ref{montecarlo}).

\end{itemize}

    \end{center} 
  \end{figure}

%Apart from this, interpolation/extrapolation algorithms could be developed to deal with different types of information (effort, catch, climatological data, etc).

\subsection{Data Output}\label{output}
Data output, of raw or transformed information, is a component where it is possible (and desirable) to facilitate the link with other platforms by using "friendly" and well-known formats. This could include formats for tabular data (for excel, R, etc), but also formats for spatial data (shapefiles, GeoJSON,etc).\\
GIS provide some very-rich and expressive visualization tools with a great potential for fisheries data, that we will discuss summarily in the next few paragraphs.\\
Web mapping is the process of designing, implementing, generating and delivering maps on the World Wide Web~\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_mapping}}. Compared to "traditional" maps, maps on the Internet have many other advantages such as "live updating", and link with many other sources of information; they provide the same interactivity as a GIS software, with the advantage of not requiring a specific software client, since they can run on an Internet browser. Web maps are normally incorporated in portals, together with other types of information, like in the case of ICES Ecosystem Data~\cite{ices2} (see figure~\ref{webmap}), but they can also be embedded in a software application (see figure~\ref{marble}).

  \begin{figure}[!ht]%[htbp]
    \begin{center} 
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{webmap}
      \caption[Web map of a ICES fish trawl Survey dataset, overlaying a grid of CPUE on top of a layer of Marble (Nasa Worldwind);]

      \label{marble} % so that one can \ref it elsewhere	
    \end{center} 
  \end{figure}

Continuous maps showing densities, can be created using grids or contours or other methods such as TINs. Grids (such as the one on figure~\ref{webmap}) are very common to represent distributions of fishing effort or catches; On the Geocrust project (see~\cite{geocrust}), the generation of grids with different sizes allowed the user to have a more generalized or more detailed perception of the fishing effort, which calls its attention to different properties (see figure~\ref{grids}).

\begin{figure}[ht]

\label{grids}
\end{figure}

GIS functions for cartography are generally based on boolean logic: that is, sharp frontiers between entities. However, when there is uncertainty and vagueness attached to a certain phenomena, this "false" precision may be awkward or simply inadequate (see~\cite{fuzzy2}). The Zadeh’s fuzzy set theory is an alternative to this boolean logic and has been proposed has a foundation to GIS design, that can be incorporated to cartographic display of phenomena with a certain imprecision associated to them. On figure~\ref{fuzzy} we see the comparison of a traditional map, with sharp boundaries and a fuzzy map.\\
On fisheries surveys, where often spatial data relies on human description (for instance a fishermen describing where he was fishing), this could provide a very interesting approach.

  \begin{figure}[!ht]%[htbp]

  \end{figure}

%A cutting-edge area of computation that has a great potential for fisheries applications is fuzzy mapping. A Fuzzy cognitive map is a map within which the relations between the elements (e.g. concepts, events, etc) of a "mental landscape" can be used to compute the "strength of impact" of these elements~\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_cognitive_map}}.
