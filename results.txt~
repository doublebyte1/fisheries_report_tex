data quality

aggregated reports

addresses confidentialityby using aggregated data

web based: 
advantages: release more often

technologies: (almost) browser independent, .NT and open source

data: commercial. research, fishermen

stratified: time, space (squares), categories

data policy (important - permissions)


uses specific xp components for pivot tables: therefore it uses a non-free OS!

open formats: xml and csv

first checkings
secondary checking
advanced (optional) checking (customizable checks)

map could be improved:
is raster
more layers
more analysis
zoom on raster is poor!


integration of data (commercial and accosutic surveys)
method decided by case


BSD licence

cooperative

bottom up approach: more collaborative (AGILE)

communication with users: workshops, forums, emails, skype, etc (wiki?)

coordinations for joint solution (do not duplicate work)

Canadian Albacore Tuna Catch and Effort Relational Database System
The db provides catch estimates, based on sales slips, logbook and hail info.
estimation at geospatial coordinates
Access


sources:
hail (space and time) fishing trip
logbook
fish slips or sale slips (landings from fish processing plants) - underestimate

plus:
missing transhipments
unreported vessel counts
slip corrections

Target: Effort (days)
Catch and effort (by area)
estimations for year based on daily mean
catch and effort by area
Estimates before the slips (end of the season)
redundancy between slips and lognooks enables cross checks
allocating catch in undefined area (following the general pattern)

Effort
days/vessel
catch/vessel
catch/day

Expand:
vessels, days, area

access: 2 databases
- queries, reports, reference tables
- collected data
- vb

database normalization
the process of organizing data to minimize redundancy is called normalization. The goal of database normalization is to decompose relations with anomalies in order to produce smaller, well-structured relations. Normalization usually involves dividing large tables into smaller (and less redundant) tables and defining relationships between them. The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of a field can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database via the defined relationships.

Metier based sampling

Evaluating Sampling Schemes
Inputation: avoid automatic procedures

review sampling frames
provide probability based sampling frame designs
fleet based fishery management

metier: homogeneous subdivision
fishery by vessel type
or fleet by voyage type
group of fishing oerations targing similar group of species
metiers: clusters in space and time
Consider trip durations when using random sampling

Target population -> PSU -> sampling frame

Multi stage sampling:
- vessel (PSU), from sampling frame and stratum
- trips
- fishing operations
- catches
- fish to measure (and age)

sampling frame: list of sampling units that can be selected independently with known probability by random sampling
PSU are the cells of the sampling frame

vessels-> trips
(PSU)-> SSU

sampling frame: identify the clusters
PSU (port in space and time)

Sampling Schemes:
Census
Probability based sampling
Non-probability based sampling(misleading and biased)

Selection of PUS using a vessel list frame
- Stratified Random Sampling with Equal Probability
- Stratified Systematic Sampling with Random Component
- Unequal probability sampling 
- Sampling with an intention to apply ration and regression estimators
- Non-probability methods
- Partial coverage of sampling frame

Selection of PSU using an area frame (LS or GLS)
- Stratified Random Sampling of PSU
- Stratified systematic sampling with random component
- Sampling with probability proportional to size
- domains of interest witthin the data

PSU: Vessel
SSU: trip
then: hauls and boxes
Target population, sampling frame, PSU
